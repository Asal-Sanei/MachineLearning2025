Mecanum-wheeled robots are known for their exceptional maneuverability, but their unique design leaves them highly vulnerable to slip, a factor that significantly hinders path tracking accuracy and control system performance.
This project aims to address this critical challenge by developing a robust and accurate slip estimation approach.
The core objective is to create a machine learning model that can predict and compensate for slip in real-time under a variety of operating conditions.
The proposed methodology involves using two cameras and image processing to gather precise real-time position data, which is then combined with encoder data to calculate actual slip. 
This discrepancy provides the essential training data for a machine learning model. We plan to explore various approaches for slip modeling, including Regression, SVR and 
MLP,LSTM,NARX-LSTM,CNN-LSTM and CNN-LSTM-Autoencoder.
The implementation of thiese models project is expected to result in a highly accurate slip estimation module and a notable improvement in the robot's overall path 
tracking capabilities.
