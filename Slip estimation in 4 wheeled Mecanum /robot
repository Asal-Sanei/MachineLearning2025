Mecanum-wheeled robots are known for their exceptional maneuverability, but their unique design leaves them highly vulnerable to slip, a factor that significantly hinders path tracking accuracy and control system performance. 
This project aims to address this critical challenge by developing a robust and accurate slip estimation approach. 
The core objective is to create a machine learning and deep learning models that can predict and compensate for slip in real-time under a variety of operating conditions. 
The proposed methodology involves using two cameras and image processing to gather precise real-time position data, which is then combined with encoder data to calculate actual slip. 
This discrepancy provides the essential training data.
We plan to explore various approaches for slip modeling, including Regression, SVR,GPR, MLP,LSTM,NARX LSTM and CNN. 
The successful implementation of this project is expected to result in a highly accurate slip estimation module and a notable improvement in the robot's overall path tracking capabilities.
